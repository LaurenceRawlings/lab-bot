Discord bot that puts users in a queue to wait for a designated assistant. Users wait in voice channels and then are
moved into a private assistant room when they are ready to be seen.

## How it works

1. Assistants join the "Create room" voice channel to generate their voice channel, along with an accompanying text
   channel which can be used to send links etc. The assistant is automatically moved into their new voice channel when
   it is created.

2. Run the `/new name:<queue name>` command to create a new queue channel.

3. Run the `/open` to open the queues. This will unlock the "Join queue" voice channels allowing users to connect and
   join the respective queue. Once a user has connected they will be moved into their new waiting room. From here the
   user is free to move into any other voice channel in the server, for example move to their friends waiting room to
   chat while they wait. If a user disconnects from the server they will automatically be removed from the queue.

4. Assistants will receive updates for each queue in the "queue" channel. Updates will show user at the front of each
   queue and assistants can accept that user into their room by reacting with âœ…. Once accepted that user will be removed
   from the queue.

5. The user and assistant can now chat in the voice channel. Also, the user will be given access to the assistants text
   chat.

6. Once finished the user can disconnect, and the assistant can accept the next person in the queue. Once disconnected
   the user will no longer have access to the assistants text chat and any messages that were sent in their session will
   be removed.
   
7. Finally, the queues can be closed with `/close` which will lock the voice channels for joining queues, however anyone
   still in a queue will remain.
